A telehandler forklift is also known as a telescopic forklift or a reach forklift. IC forklifts are a different class of forklift from the previous ones, as these models are often better suited for outdoor use. FMI provides an exclusive analysis of Global Pallet Trucks Market”.

With a solid schedule of consistent and high-quality maintenance, your forklift can be relied upon to provide years of worry-free performance.

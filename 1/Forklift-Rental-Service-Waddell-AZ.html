The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck.

On electric trucks the nameplate shall also show the truck weight without battery, the minimum and maximum service weights of the battery to be used, nominal voltage for which truck is arranged, and, where required, identifying number of battery required, and maximum rated ampere hour capacity for which truck is equipped.</p>

<p>ACT offers very flexible forklift rental time frames, as well as other material handling equipment rental packages.

The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>

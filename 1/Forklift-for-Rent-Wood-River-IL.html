Many of the hazards posed by forklifts can be mitigated with custom signage and clear visual communication.</p>
<p>If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>

For instance, if a heavy load brings the center of gravity all the way to the front axle — the theoretical edge of the stability triangle — sudden braking could shift the load forward and out of the triangle altogether.</p>

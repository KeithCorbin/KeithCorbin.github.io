Our nationwide dealer network has a broad range of lift truck models available for immediate rental. Fewer Responsibilities: With the purchase of a service or maintenance plan, if anything does go wrong with the leased forklift, the dealer will take care of it.</p>

<p>Now, when there is no load present, the lift truck's center of gravity is firmly inside the triangle.

The lift helps going through or over tough terrain and is especially great for off-roading and mudding enthusiasts.</p>

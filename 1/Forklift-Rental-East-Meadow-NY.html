For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.

<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>The Industrial Truck Association (ITA) is responsible for defining the classification of the industrial Forklift Trucks and also is responsible for imposing a set of rules and regulations on the industries using the Forklift Trucks. We pride ourselves on providing a wide variety of equipment options for every application, while our full service branch offers used equipment sales, short and long term rentals, emergency and preventative maintenance.</p>

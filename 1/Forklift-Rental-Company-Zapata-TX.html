Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material. If you refuel the tanks twice a day (the average for full-time use), this equates to a yearly fuel cost of $1,500 for electric, $15,000 for diesel and about $12,500 for propane.

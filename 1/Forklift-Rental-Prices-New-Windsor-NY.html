Overhead Guard = A framework above the operator's head attached to a lift truck to protect an operator. Forklift rental is by far the most flexible and cost effective way to ensure your warehouse operation or distribution center is fully equipped during high volume periods, eliminating bottlenecks and productivity losses.</p>

Regardless of the order picker or forklift job, one thing is for certain: if your employees drive order picker trucks, they need an order picker license.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>

<h2>Fork Truck Accidents And Forklift Health And Safety Berwick </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>

Check your equipment before your shift because your fork lift is your responsibility, wear the proper gear, good footwear and a hard hat and enter and exit the forklift carefully.</p>

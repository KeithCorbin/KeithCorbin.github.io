<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. We only sell the very best, and we want Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Orange County drivers to know it. Give us a call at 877-772-3022 if you have any questions or have an interest in learning more about these trucks. OSHA Section 1910.178 lists safety procedures for fork trucks, tractors, platform lift trucks, motorized hand trucks, and other specialized industrial trucks powered by electric motors or internal combustion engines.” The most important rule is that each forklift reaches the basic standards for safety.</p>

<h2>Manual Pallet Truck Hazlehurst </h2>

Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>As many models in our fleet feature four wheel drive, these machines are ideal to work outside carrying out heavy duty operations.

Courtesy Chevrolet does our lifted trucks in house so you know you are getting a great deal and a quality job done.</p>

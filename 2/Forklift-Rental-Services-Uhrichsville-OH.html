<h2>Forklifts & Lift Trucks Uhrichsville </h2>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).

<p>It had a capacity of 6,000 pounds (2,724 kg) at a lift height of 22.5 feet (7 m), or 3,000 pounds (1,362 kg) at 35 feet (11 m). In 1962, the first telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift came on the market. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>
<p>A rental can also serve as a test drive,” allowing you to test out different types of equipment to determine what you want to purchase.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air.

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.

Ahern Rentals has over 40,000 pieces of equipment and vehicles available for rent across the US. A work platform of at least 20 inches wide must be securely attached to the lifting carriage or forks.

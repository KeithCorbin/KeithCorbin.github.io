<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. Dayton hand hydraulic pallet trucks are manually operated industrial duty products designed to lift maximum weight. Roe Osborn Rough terrain forklifts (or telehandlers) were designed to move material from off-loading zones closer to jobsites and to lift manageable loads to elevated work areas.

The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.

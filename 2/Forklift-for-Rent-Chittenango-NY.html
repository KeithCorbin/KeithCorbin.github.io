It is also not a substitute for a powered industrial truck operator training program. These calculations take into account variations in design including tire, mast, and other deflections, and provide a means for predicting with reasonable accuracy the stability of fork trucks. The second hand forklifts, offered by us, for buying and selling purposes are in fine working condition and thus, require minimum maintenance.</p>

A 2000kg load can be sufficiently moved with some effort; however, with poor ground, a poor quality pallet jack, unstable loads, slopes, etc., it will be much more difficult for the pallet jack worker.</p>

Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.

Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking.

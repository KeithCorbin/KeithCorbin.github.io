<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Parts & Service - Our forklift parts and service departments are ready at a moments notice and can repair any brand of equipment in your fleet. Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility. When you need to move materials, shift supplies, or store objects on a job site, a rough terrain forklift can do the job.</p>

JCB : Known for their proprietary Dieselmax engine, JCB equipment is powered by a 74 hp low-rev engine shown to enhance efficiency in rough terrain situations while providing maximum fuel efficiency.</p>

<p>Corporate rates are offered by some larger rental companies. Since they can work on all kinds of job sites, rough terrain forklifts are some of the most versatile small machines. Many models are equipped with stabilizers to ensure safe movement with shifting loads from one side of the machine to the other. When not in use, pallet jacks should be rolled into an area that does not have pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts have four-wheel power steering, but it can be changed into two-wheel as well. The Raymond 4460 sit down forklift features a low profile and excellent operator visibility for exceptional performance and productivity in confined spaces.

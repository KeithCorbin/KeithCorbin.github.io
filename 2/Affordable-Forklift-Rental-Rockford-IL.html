The best way to prevent rough terrain forklift-related injury, accidents or death is by getting educated, licensed and certified in Rough Terrain Forklift Training.

<p>This motor does the work of lifting the load and moving the hand truck. Powered High-Lift Trucks: Order-Picker Safety is a complete package that tends to all safety needs of order-pickers and drivers and will help keep your facility incident-free in its daily operational use of powered high-lift trucks.

But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>

<p>In addition to forklifts, BigRentz has lifts, trucks, and construction equipment available. Moreover, the demand picks up in the new energy forklift market to which more and more entrants have accessed. Avoid additional charges for any damages made or caused by the wrong use of the rental equipment under your care and custody. Do not tow or push railway cars or trucks with a forklift.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>

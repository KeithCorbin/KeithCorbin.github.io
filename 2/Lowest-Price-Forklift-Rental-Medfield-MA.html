<h2>Narrow Aisle Lift Truck Medfield</h2>
<p>Class 3: Electric Motor Hand or Hand-Rider Trucks. Using the add-a-leaf will increase the height, but sometimes makes the suspension ride rough because of the added spring rate.

It is therefore essential to know the exact capacity and safety features of the specific forklift you are handling.</p>

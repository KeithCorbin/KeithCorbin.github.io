<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. You must consider whether the forklift will be working indoors or outdoors, whether it will work on smooth floors or rough terrain and what lift heights and types of product or materials will be involved.

When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>

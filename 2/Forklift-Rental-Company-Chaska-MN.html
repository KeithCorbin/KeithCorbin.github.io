<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Today's leaders, especially Toyota and KION, continue to expand their reach beyond industrial trucks and into the broader market for supply chain services. As a forklift operator, you don't have to worry about the load center as long as you respect the listed weight capacity and keep the load balanced. There are various hand pallet trucks such as electric hand pallet trucks and hydraulic hand pallet trucks to suit your warehouse needs.</p>

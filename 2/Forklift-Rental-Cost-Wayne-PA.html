<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. When you're looking to buy a forklift in Bristol, the first thing you should do is pick up the phone to us. It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

The 2C5000 became the primary model in 2010 and had maintained its status as one of the premier forklift models ever since.</p>

The product has been designed and manufactured for maximum load capacity.</p>
<h2>Clamp Lift Truck Wayne</h2>

Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>

The multi-purpose nature of our products means that they have many potential applications, both in rough terrain and industrial environments: construction, industry, farming, mining, military and agriculture, to name just a few.

Long-term maintenance and upkeep on these lifted trucks can be higher than standard models, so keep that in mind when considering your options.

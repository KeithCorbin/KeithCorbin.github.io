If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late.

<h3>How High Will a Telescopic Forklift Go in South Orange NJ 07079</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>Some of the conditions which may affect stability are, ground and floor conditions, grade, speed, loading (trucks equipped with attachments behave as partially loaded trucks even when operated without a load on the attachment), battery weight, dynamic and static forces, and the judgment exercised by the operator.

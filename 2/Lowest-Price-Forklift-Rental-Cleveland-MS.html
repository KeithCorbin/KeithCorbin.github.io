Take a closer look at the most important features to find out how rough terrain forklifts get the job done.</p>
<p>Our Lorry Loader training course (HIAB) delivered by Lift A Load Training ensures successful candidates have the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating a lorry loader.

The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>

Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts.

Many models are equipped with stabilizers to ensure safe movement with shifting loads from one side of the machine to the other. When not in use, pallet jacks should be rolled into an area that does not have pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>Local Yale dealers provide service and support, just as they would standard lift trucks. Not every warehouse manager is ready to pay for rentals with cash.

While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

The extra horsepower allows it to tackle a wide variety of terrain and reliably heft loads to great heights on unpaved and uneven surfaces. The 13,973lb (6,340kg) JCB 930 RTFL is powered by our highly efficient 74hp (55kW) EcoMax engine and has a 6,000lb (2,772kg) lift capacity.</p>

<p>The forklift driver training will cover all the key areas; such as Health and Safety Executive (HSE) legislation and safety guidelines, an introduction to the forklift truck, how to start, stop and basic maneuvering, operating with pallets and loads, and difficult loads. A body lift will retain all of the factory suspension and alignment. Particularly in confined conditions, our electric reach trucks set new benchmarks thanks to their compact construction and outstanding lifting capacity.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>

<p>Our friendly staff will work with you closely to better understand your operations and requirements, and help you choose the right forklift. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world. Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1, of at full rearward till permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, whichever is less stable, Where tilt restrictions for various elevations are employed, and the rearward tilt position is determined to be less stable, the truck should be tested at maximum elevation for each tilt restriction permitted by the truck mechanism.</p>

Our 5000 Series Orderpickers are all ideal options to maximize space utilization, decrease damage to inventory and increase productivity with palletless handling.

<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>

By driving a lifted truck, you will have more confidence in getting where you need to go, especially if you live in an area where the roads are rough.
